Lena Hall, the Tony Award-winning actress and cabaret singer, will soon embark on an ambitious project to pay homage to her favorite musicians and bands by releasing a new EP album on the first Friday of every month in 2018, as well as a music video every week.
The project, called “Obsessed,” begins Jan. 5 with songs from John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask’s rock musical, “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” which she starred in on Broadway alongside Neil Patrick Harris in 2014. She went on to win the Tony for best featured actress in a musical. On Friday, she will also release two music videos.
Ms. Hall, with Watt White on guitar, sings “Falling Slowly,” a ballad from the movie and Broadway musical “Once.”
Ms. Hall’s tentative schedule for the rest of the year includes a diverse slate of tributes: to Peter Gabriel and Elton John, for example, as well as Beck and Pink. Also on the roster are Nirvana, Jack White and Radiohead.
Toward the end of the year, she will record songs by the Cranberries and Muse, as well as David Bowie and Chris Cornell, of Soundgarden and Audioslave.
SKB Records (Sh-K-Boom/Ghostlight), a heavyweight label in the world of Broadway cast recordings, will produce Ms. Hall’s EPs. Her previous album, “Sin & Salvation: Live at the Carlyle,” was produced independently.
