WASHINGTON — An American service member was killed and four others were wounded after a skirmish on Monday in Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan, the Pentagon said.
The episode took place in Achin, near the Pakistan border, in an area where a number of ambushes and strikes have occurred in recent months. The Pentagon did not indicate whether the episode involved the Taliban or members of the Islamic State, but both groups have been active in the area.
“We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our own,” Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of the Afghanistan war effort, said in a statement. “At this very difficult time, our heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of our fallen and wounded brothers.”
Defense Department officials said they would have more information after they have notified family members.
