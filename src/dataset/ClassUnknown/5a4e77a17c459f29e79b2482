The five most frequently viewed listings on The New York Times’s “Find a Home” site last month included an Upper East Side house as lavish as it was costly and an Encino, Calif., home featured on a popular Nickelodeon show.

$7,590,000
77 Old Colony Road 
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
An opulent six-bedroom, six-bath gated estate with more than 9,165 square feet of living space was the most popular listing in December. The home features lavish millwork and moldings, a chef’s kitchen, a home theater and grounds with a pool.

527 East 72nd Street, No. 1CD/2D
Upper East Side
The second most viewed listing was a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath prewar duplex overlooking a sunny cul-de-sac on the East River. The listing noted the surrounding parks and the quiet atmosphere of the out-of-the-way location.

$79,500,000
8 East 62nd Street
Upper East Side
A Beaux-Arts house, better described as a palace, was the third most viewed property, with six bedrooms and nine baths spread over five floors, and plenty of marble and soaring ceilings. All too much? There is also a rooftop Zen garden and basement spa.

$1,950,000
3878 Alonzo Avenue
Encino, Calif.
Nickelodeon viewers may recognize the fourth most popular listing as the TV home from “Drake and Josh.” The five-bedroom, four-bath house is built for entertaining, with a large dining room, family room with fireplace and bar, pretty outdoor areas and a tennis court.

5
$250,000
46 West 71st Street, No. 2A
Lincoln Square
A one-bedroom just off Central Park at this price surely comes with a caveat. Our fifth most popular listing included a rent-stabilized tenant; a buyer would need to accept that he or she might never live in the unit or receive fair-market rent.
