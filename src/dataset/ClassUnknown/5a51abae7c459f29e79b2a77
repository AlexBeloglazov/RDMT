Jillian Holmes Vandall and Andrew Miao were married Jan. 6 in Manhattan. Devon G. Kelley, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for this event, officiated at the Bowery Hotel.
Mrs. Miao, 31, is a senior publicity manager, representing children’s book authors and illustrators, at Random House in New York. She is also a freelance calligrapher. She graduated cum laude from the University of New Hampshire.
She is the daughter of Peter J. Vandall of New Canaan, Conn., and the late Betsy Holmes Vandall. The bride’s father retired as the vice president for sales and marketing at Pez Candy in Orange, Conn. Her mother was a nurse in the recovery room at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Conn.
Mr. Miao, 31, is a risk-management consultant at Promontory Financial Group, a financial services risk manager in Manhattan. He graduated from Williams College.
He is the son of Terry Shu of Boston and Walter C. Miao of Belleville, N.J. The groom’s mother retired as a managing director in the asset management division of JPMorgan Chase & Company, the Manhattan investment bank. His father retired from a subsidiary of the International Data Corporation, a market research and consulting firm, for which he was a senior vice president for technology research in the Manhattan office.
The groom is a great-grandson of Dai Jitao, a politician and leading member of China’s Kuomintang political party, a nationalist organization founded in the early 20th century and now the main opposition party in Taiwan.
The couple met in 2013, at a Halloween party at the apartment of a mutual friend in Brooklyn. She was wearing a pink spandex unitard and though he had neglected to dress for the occasion, he retroactively declared that he’d been costumed as “the boy next door.” They had their first date shortly thereafter.
