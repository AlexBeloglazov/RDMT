52 Places to go in 2018
We received over 13,000 applications for our first-of-its-kind job: a traveler who will go to each and every place on this year’s Places to Go list. 
It sounded like a dream job to many: one that would take a traveler to all 52 destinations on this year’s Places to Go list. We received over 13,000 applications from an amazing variety of people, from a father-daughter team to a best-selling author. (We heard all about the submission process in a Q. and A. with Monica Drake, then the Travel editor.) Above is a look at some of those applicants. We will announce the winner, along with the full list of destinations, later this week.
