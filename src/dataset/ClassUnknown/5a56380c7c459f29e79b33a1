52 Places to Go in 2018
Her name is Jada Yuan, and you’ll have all of 2018 to get to know her. 
Each year, we put together a list of 52 places to inspire travelers for the coming year. This year, we’re actually sending a traveler to each and every place. You have seen some of our favorite submissions (we got 13,000 of them) and perhaps perused this year’s list — now meet the traveler: Jada Yuan. 
Jada has spent the last decade at New York magazine, covering celebrities, film festivals and presidential conventions. She grew up in northern New Mexico, has a degree in history from Yale University and currently lives in Brooklyn. Not for long, though — her first stop on her journey will be our No. 1 destination, New Orleans.  Follow her on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook as she begins her travels. She will be looking for your advice as she makes her way around the world.
Here is a little more from Jada’s submission video on why she thought she would be a great fit for the job. Obviously, we agreed.
