The new year began almost the same way as 2017 ended: with outsize closings of combination-ready penthouses at 432 Park Avenue.
Two half-floor sponsor units on the 91st floor of this super-tall building, on Midtown’s so-called Billionaires’ Row, between 56th and 57th Streets, sold to an unknown buyer for a combined $60,083,577. Each apartment had been on the market for around $40 million.
This was New York City’s most expensive closed sale in January, according to property records.
Just a few weeks earlier, in mid-December, two half-floor units on the 92nd floor and one on the 93rd of 432 Park, also listed at nearly $40 million apiece, sold to another unnamed buyer for $91.13 million. It was the priciest sale for all of 2017, as well as the third highest ever for a residence in the city.
In other notable January transactions, the musician John Mellencamp bought a co-op loft in SoHo. In TriBeCa, the actor Josh Hartnett sold his penthouse loft, while Holger Bartel, the chief executive of the website Travelzoo, also sold a penthouse.

On the Upper West Side, Aroldis Chapman, a pitcher for the New York Yankees, bought a new condo, and the estate of Jack Rollins, a film producer and talent manager who died in 2015, sold his co-op.

And on Fifth Avenue, Bruce Winston, a son of the jeweler Harry Winston, purchased an apartment, while the Walt Disney Company’s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, and his wife, Willow Bay, a veteran broadcast journalist, sold theirs.
Also, Gerald E. Ross, a partner at the New York law firm Fryer & Ross, sold another apartment at 15 Central Park West — this one for $21.5 million. It was January’s second most expensive closing.
THE LATEST BIG SALES AT 432 PARK were units 91A and 91B. Each has just under 4,000 square feet, with three bedrooms, three and a half baths, and a library, as well as dizzying views of the city and beyond.
The combined monthly carrying costs total $32,119, according to the listings with Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
The 91st floor of 432 Park originally had contained only one full-floor apartment, as did the 92nd through 95th. But in 2015, to help spur sales, the developers, Macklowe Properties and the CIM Group, divided those floors into two lower-priced units. Now some of the floors are reverting back.
The 96-story, concrete-and-glass tower is the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere, at 1,396 feet.
IN THE RUNNER-UP SALE, at 15 Central Park West, Mr. Ross, the lawyer, sold unit 8B, a four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath residence overlooking Central Park. This 3,478-square-foot home also has a separate dining room that could be converted into a fifth bedroom, according to the listing with Compass.
Mr. Ross had purchased the apartment in late 2007, as the building was opening, for nearly $11.15 million, and returned it to the market in February 2017 with a $33 million price tag. The most recent asking price was $25 million.

This was his second sale at the two-tower limestone condominium near 61st Street. Mr. Ross made a bigger profit, though, in 2015, when he sold a larger unit next door, 8A, for $35 million, which was almost double the $17 million he had paid in 2008.
MR. MELLENCAMP PAID $2.3 MILLION, according to property records, for a live-work loft on the entire first floor of 66 Grand Street, a low-rise cast-iron building near Wooster Street in SoHo. The 1,800-square-foot unit, with 13-foot ceilings and wood and polished concrete floors, has two bedrooms, two baths, a home office and a large work studio.
