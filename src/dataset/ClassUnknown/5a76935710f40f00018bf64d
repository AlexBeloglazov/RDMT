Ms. Zak, 28, works in New York as a programmatic buying manager in digital advertising at Adobe Systems, the computer software company. She graduated from Bucknell.

Dr. Schosheim, 29, is a pediatric resident at St. Peter’s University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., and in July is to begin a pediatric gastroenterology fellowship at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital. He graduated from the University of Miami and received a medical degree from St. George's University School of Medicine in St. George’s, Grenada.
He is the son of Joanne Katz Schosheim and Dr. John P. Schosheim of Boca Raton. His mother, a speech pathologist, is a partner in Speech Associates of Boca Raton. His father is a psychiatrist in private practice, also in Boca Raton, and he is the medical director of Ruth & Norman Rales Jewish Family Services in Boca Raton.
The couple met through JDate in 2014 after noticing each was a Miami Heat basketball fan from their profiles. During their first date at an underground sake bar in the East Village of New York, they found more personal Florida connections. They grew up in neighboring Boca Raton communities and, when Ms. Zak was in third grade, she and her mother belonged to the same mother-daughter book group as Mr. Schosheim’s mother and sister.
