The volume of Toronto home sales has dropped in recent weeks as many buyers continue to play the waiting game in the wake of a cooling housing market, brokers said. Many noticed prospective buyers holding off on bidding in hopes that the market will turn further in their favor, but other brokers said that condos in particular are being snatched up quickly.
Talk of a slow patch came as the Canadian Real Estate Association revealed that home sales across the country hit their lowest level in three years in January, decreasing by 14.5 percent from the month before. While the national average home price rose in that same time period, Toronto’s prices fell by 4.1 percent to reach an average 736,783 Canadian dollars (about $584,500.)
