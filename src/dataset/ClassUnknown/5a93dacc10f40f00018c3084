With the right blend of aesthetics and practicality, children’s chairs can be just as pleasing to parents. For many grown-ups, they offer a chance to play with colors and shapes that might normally seem too bold or risky.
After all, “when you’re designing for the main part of the home, it’s serious,” said Susana Simonpietri, creative director of the Brooklyn-based interior design firm Chango & Co. “With kids’ rooms, you can just let loose and have fun.”
Embracing this philosophy, Ms. Simonpietri creates spaces for her youngest clients with features like rope swings, watermelon wallpaper and, of course, plenty of pint-size statement-making chairs.
“You can find miniature bentwood chairs in bright colors,” she said, as well as scaled-down modern classics by the likes of Norman Cherner, Verner Panton and Harry Bertoia. “How cute is that?”
• Is the chair easy to clean? Ms. Simonpietri recommended choosing something made of plastic or painted, so it can be easily wiped down. “You want kids to be able to play with crayons, markers and glitter,” she said, “and for the parents not to have to worry.”

• What size is it? Children’s chairs have different seat heights intended for different ages, so choose carefully. And remember, Ms. Simonpietri said, that when you are looking at photos online “it’s very hard to tell what’s what.”

• How much does it weigh? Children should be able to move the chair on their own, Ms. Simonpietri said, so heavier models are better for older children.
