Snake Plant (sansevieria): “Snake plants have earned a reputation as “unkill-able” for a reason,” said Rebecca Bullene, of Greenery NYC. “They are more tolerant of crummy indoor conditions — especially low lighting — than almost any other houseplant. Just be sure not to over water.”
ZZ (Zamioculcas zamifolia): “They tolerate both full sun and low light, but do best in a bright, indirect setting. Native to the semiarid regions of Eastern Africa, they are also very tolerant of long periods of drought.”
Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae): “The Bird of Paradise is a great plant for those who have a tendency to over water,” Ms. Bullene said. “They appreciate a warm, humid environment and prefer bright indirect light.”
