Our recent article “The Yorkie’s Dominance: We Analyzed Every Dog Registration in New York” told the story of the city’s changing neighborhoods through the dogs that live in them, noting the curious phenomenon of how smaller dogs seem to predominate in areas where prices are rising.
The inverse, of course, isn’t usually true: The appearance of larger dogs doesn’t mean prices are falling. But if you own one of those big dogs, where are you likely to live?

This week, we dug into New York’s dog registration database again, analyzing 583,841 dog registrations between 2012 and 2016, to determine where big dogs are most popular — or, to be precise, which boroughs have the highest percentage of dogs that weigh more than 50 pounds.
Staten Island came out on top, with some 18 percent of its registrations (or 10,147) for large dogs. With plenty of backyards and outdoor space, that seemed to make sense. Densely populated Manhattan had close to the smallest share — also fairly predictable — with just under 14 percent of its registrations for dogs over 50 pounds.

At the neighborhood level, it was less predictable. The highest rates of large dogs, it turns out, can be found not just in Stapleton, on Staten Island, but in Manhattan’s cramped SoHo/Greenwich Village area, where an impressive 19 percent of the registrations were for big dogs.
An earlier version of this article misstated the number of large dogs registered in Staten Island. There were 10,147 registered, not 10,187.
