Slipper chairs come in many variations, but they all share a defining characteristic.
“It’s an armless lounge chair,” said Damon Liss, an interior designer in New York.
Still, a slipper chair isn’t merely an exercise in subtraction. By forgoing armrests, it adds something crucial to a room: a relaxed sense of style.
“There are a lot of places, especially in apartments, where you want something that is visually lighter” than an armchair, said Mr. Liss, who frequently uses slipper chairs in living rooms and bedrooms. “It’s the concept of balance: If you have lots of pieces with lots of arms everywhere, it can get too busy.”
From a functional standpoint, a slipper chair is “easy to flop into” from almost any direction, he said, because there are no arms to hurdle.

And it also provides an excuse to cozy up to a loved one, he pointed out: “Two people can easily sit on one.”

• What should you look for when you’re choosing a slipper chair? “Because there are no arms, you need to have interest from something else — maybe it’s a beautiful fabric,” Mr. Liss said, but it could also be an interesting wooden frame.

• How laid-back should it be? “You see them upright and more lounge-y,” Mr. Liss said, but he usually prefers the latter, with a more reclined back.
• What is the ideal seat height? “About 15 or 16 inches high,” he said.
