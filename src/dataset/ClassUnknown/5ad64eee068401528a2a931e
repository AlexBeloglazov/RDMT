The longtime Rangers anthem singer John Amirante has died. He was 83.
His wife, Annie, told the Rangers he died of natural causes Tuesday in New York after about a week in the hospital.
The Bronx-born Amirante sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” before Rangers games at Madison Square Garden from 1980 until he retired in 2015 and on special occasions afterward. He also sang before Knicks, Yankees and Mets games.
In a statement posted on the Rangers’ Twitter feed, goaltender Henrik Lundqvist said it was “always special to hear his name, see him walk out and sing the way he did.”
A memorable rendition came on June 14, 1994, when the Rangers beat the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the final to win their first Stanley Cup since 1940.
