Brooklyn renters experienced a fourth straight month of price drops in March, paying a median of $2,629 a month, or 6.3 percent less than a year before. In Manhattan, the median rent was $3,168 a month, 3.8 percent less than a year earlier — the lowest it has been since October of 2011.
Those figures reflect the net-effective rent — the median monthly rent, taking into account various concessions, including months of free rent and broker commissions paid by the landlord — according to the latest Elliman Report, prepared by the real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel.
Concessions played a big role in pushing down the net-effective rent in northwest Queens, where renters paid a median of $2,559 a month in March, or 6.4 percent less than a year earlier, and 63 percent of those leases included concessions, compared with 42.7 percent the year before.
Landlords have historically protected actual rents, enticing would-be renters with concessions first. “But it’s not enough,” said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel. “In the last year, we’re seeing actual rents decline in addition to concessions expanding.”
Overdevelopment of higher-end rentals is one reason for the trend, Mr. Miller said: “There’s so much low-cost capital dying for a home, and developers develop until they can’t develop anymore.”
