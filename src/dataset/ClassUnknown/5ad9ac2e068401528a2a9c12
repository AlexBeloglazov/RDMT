Spring men’s wear that channels the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe’s visual world.
By Alex Tudela
Exploring topics such as black male sexuality and the underground BDSM scene, Robert Mapplethorpe immortalized the marginalized communities of early 1980s New York City with his striking images — and challenged conservative notions of beauty. While his subjects were just as often unclothed, leather wear appeared frequently in Mapplethorpe’s photographic world — for example, in his iconic X Portfolio — as a symbol of both sensuality and subversion. And that visual language is as relevant as ever in fashion today. Inspired by the late photographer’s work, we picked the standout leather pieces from the spring/summer 2018 men’s collections.
