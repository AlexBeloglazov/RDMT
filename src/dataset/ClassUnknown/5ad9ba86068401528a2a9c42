BERLIN —  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to discuss Russia when she meets U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington next week, a government spokesman said on Friday.
The United States on April 6 imposed sanctions against Russian entities and individuals to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and what the U.S. Treasury Department dubbed other "malign activity."
