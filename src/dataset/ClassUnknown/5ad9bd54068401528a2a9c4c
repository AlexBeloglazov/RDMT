SEOUL —  The board of General Motors' South Korean unit delayed its decision on filing for court-led rehabilitation proceedings to Monday, said two sources familiar with the situation.
GM Korea was not immediately reachable for comment.
The company and its union failed to reach a wage deal by Friday, breaching a deadline previously set by the U.S. automaker to seek bankruptcy protection for the loss-making unit.
