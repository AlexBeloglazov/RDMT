WASHINGTON â€” The No. 3 House Republican leader has been released from a hospital after follow-up surgery related to the wounds he received from a shooting at a GOP baseball practice 10 months ago.
Rep. Steve Scalise (skuh-LEES') of Louisiana is out of MedStar Washington Hospital Center after successful surgery Monday and is expected to recover at home for several days.
That's according to a statement from the medical center and his office. An earlier statement said he had "a series of planned, inpatient procedures."
Scalise suffered shattered bones and damaged internal organs in the June shooting that left him near death. U.S. Capitol Police and other officers killed the gunman, who held grievances against President Donald Trump and the GOP.
Scalise's viewed a potential successor to retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan.
