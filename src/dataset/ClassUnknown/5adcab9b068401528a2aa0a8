LITTLE ROCK, Ark. â€” Gov. Asa Hutchinson has been a fixture in Arkansas' Republican Party long before the state became solidly red. But he faces a challenge from a gun rights advocate who's mounting an uphill and sparsely funded bid to unseat him in the primary by trying to portray him as not conservative enough for the state.
Hutchinson faces Jan Morgan, a cable commentator and gun range owner, in the May 22 Republican primary for governor. Morgan has far trailed Hutchinson in fundraising, reporting nearly $16,000 in the bank compared to the governor's $2.4 million.
The two have split over issues such as tax cuts, Medicaid expansion and economic development incentives in GOP primary campaign.
