HANOVER, Germany â€” Deutsche Telekom unit T-Systems should return to profitability in 2020 as the company undergoes a digital makeover, new Chief Executive Adel Al-Saleh said on Monday at the Hannover Trade Fair.
American Al-Saleh, who took over the loss-making IT services company in January, also said at a presentation that SAP had certified the Open Telekom Cloud for its suite of business software, offering an alternative to hyperscale services such as AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google.
