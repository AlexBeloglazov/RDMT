WASHINGTON â€” Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday she held "intensive" talks with U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer focused on U.S. proposals for auto rules in a new North American Free Trade Agreement.
"There are of course a number of other significant issues that still need to be resolved and we look forward to digging into those issues as discussions continue tomorrow," Freeland said as she left the meeting with Lighthizer in Washington.
