BERLIN â€” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday that the German government wanted Opel plants in Germany to be shored up for the future as France's PSA Group, which last year bought Opel, seeks to make savings.
"The German government has an interest in Opel sites in Germany being secured for the long-term," Altmaier said. "At the moment we're discussing how the Eisenach plant in particular can be stabilised and secured."
