LONDON â€” Facebook will review how it operates in Myanmar and needs more policy people on the ground, its chief technology officer said on Thursday, after criticism that the platform has inflamed ethnic violence there.
Asked by a British lawmaker if Facebook was reviewing how it operates in Myanmar, Mike Schroepfer replied: "Absolutely." 
"The situation in Myanmar is awful," he said. "We need more policy people on the ground."
