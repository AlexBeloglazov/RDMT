PARIS —  French inflation rose unexpectedly in April to hit a five and a half year high, preliminary EU-harmonised data from the INSEE statistics agency showed on Friday.
INSEE said French consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in April, giving a 12-month rate of 1.8 percent, the highest since October 2012 and up from 1.7 percent in March.
A Reuters poll of 24 economists had on average forecast that inflation had held steady at 1.7 percent with estimates ranging from 1.4 percent to 1.9 percent.
INSEE said the increase was driven by higher prices for fresh foods and energy, which tend to be highly volatile due to seasonal factors. Prices for manufactured goods fell 0.3 percent over one year while growth in services prices slowed slightly.
Separately, INSEE said that producer prices rose 0.4 percent in March, giving a 12-month rate of 2.5 percent.
