OSLO â€” The Norwegian government may impose a ceiling on interest rates for consumer loans unless recently imposed regulations help curb a growing trend of small, expensive loans, Finance Minister Siv Jensen said in a statement on Friday.
Current regulations will be allowed to work for a while, to asses their impact, before any decision on a rate ceiling is made, she added.
