HUDDERSFIELD, England —  Everton piled the pressure back on relegation-threatened Huddersfield by winning their English Premier League match 2-0 on Saturday.
Turkey forward Cenk Tosun's clinical finish gave Everton a halftime lead and Senegal midfielder Idrissa Gueye blasted home their second with 13 minutes left.
It was a damaging defeat for Huddersfield, whose victory over Watford in their last match gave their survival hopes a big lift.
A seventh home loss of the season, though, coupled with wins for relegation rivals Crystal Palace, Southampton and West Bromwich Albion, has left Huddersfield three points above the drop zone.
Everton has lost only one of their last seven games, winning four, but their travelling fans made clear their displeasure at the continued presence of Sam Allardyce in their dugout.
