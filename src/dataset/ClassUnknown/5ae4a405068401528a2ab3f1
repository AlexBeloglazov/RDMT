April 28 (Reuters) - CRYSTAL PALACE 5 LEICESTER CITY 0
Crystal Palace kept their Premier League survival hopes very much alive with a 5-0 thrashing of 10-man Leicester City, who had Marc Albrighton sent off in the 56th minute, at Selhurst Park on Saturday.
Wilfried Zaha put the hosts ahead with his fourth goal in four games from James McArthur’s backheel after both teams had cleared chances off the line – Kelechi Iheanacho from Palace's James Tomkins and Joel Ward denying Leicester’s Jamie Vardy.
The pair combined again to put Palace two up before halftime, McArthur swivelling to shoot low into the bottom corner from a square ball by Zaha, who minutes earlier brought a diving save from Ben Hamer.
Leicester were on top just after the break but wilted after Albrighton was dismissed for bringing down Zaha, leaving Palace to wrap up the points with goals by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Patrick van Aanholt and substitute Christian Benteke’s penalty. 
Palace climbed to a season high of 11th in the standings with 38 points, six clear of the relegation zone with two matches to play. Leicester are ninth with 44.
