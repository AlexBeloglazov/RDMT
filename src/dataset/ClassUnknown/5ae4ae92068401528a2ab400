(Reuters) - Sadio Mane will be fit to face AS Roma in Liverpool's Champions League semi-final decider in Rome on Wednesday.
The Senegalese winger missed Saturday's 0-0 Premier League draw with Stoke City with a thigh strain.
But Juergen Klopp confirmed his availability for Rome as Liverpool seek to consolidate their 5-2 first-leg win.
"Sadio didn't play, so he will be fine for Wednesday," said Klopp, who added Liverpool had no new injury concerns.
