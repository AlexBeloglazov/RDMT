PARIS â€” Olympique Lyonnais chalked up their seventh successive Ligue 1 win when they beat Nantes 2-0 on Saturday to go second in the table, boosting their chances of qualifying for the Champions League group stage next season.
Dutchman Memphis Depay scored the first goal, his seventh in the last six league games, and set up the second as Lyon moved above AS Monaco who were held 0-0 at home by Amiens.
Depay broke the deadlock five minutes before halftime with a superb strike as he collected Nabil Fekir's pass on the edge of the penalty area, moved the ball to his left foot and scored with a low drive.
Bertrand Traore slotted home the second midway through the second half after Depay beat two defenders before slipping the ball to the Burkinabe forward.
The top two teams qualify for the Champions League next season and third place earns a spot in the qualifying rounds.
Lyon have 72 points from 35 games with Monaco on 71 and Olympique de Marseille, who visit Angers on Sunday, fourth with 69. Paris St Germain have already wrapped up the title.
Maverick forward Mario Balotelli converted a second-half penalty to give sixth-placed Nice a 1-1 draw at Strasbourg.
