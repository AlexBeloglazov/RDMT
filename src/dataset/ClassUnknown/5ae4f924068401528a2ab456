CHESTER, Pa. â€” Borek Dockal scored the go-ahead goal in the 72nd minute, and the Philadelphia Union beat D.C. United 3-2 on Saturday.
Dockal blasted a right-footed shot from a narrow angle past goalkeeper Steve Clark, who reeled backward as the ball went above his head. It was Dockal's first career MLS goal and the Union (2-3-2) held on from there.
Two minutes earlier, Darren Mattocks tied it at 2-all for D.C. United (1-4-2) with a leaping right-footed stab volley to finish Zoltan Stieber's diagonal cross.
Stieber gave United the early lead with a left-footed shot in the seventh minute.
Ilsinho leveled it for the Union at in the 37th minute, and C.J. Sapong gave Philadelphia a 2-1 lead in the 60th.
The Union's three goals doubled their total output for the season.
