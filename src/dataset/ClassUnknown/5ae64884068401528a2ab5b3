CONCORD, N.C. â€” Steve Torrence won the Top Fuel final Sunday in the NHRA Four-Wide Nationals for his series-best third victory of the season.
Torrence had a 3.813-second pass at 326.56 mph at zMAX Dragway to beat Doug Kalitta, Terry McMillen and Clay Millican in the final round. Torrence has 19 career victories.
"Getting the win today is pretty unbelievable, but my team did such a great job with this track and we know that every win is special," Torrence said. "This is a much-needed win because I know some of these competitors are starting to figure it out, so we are going to take as many of these Mello Yello points as we can get in the early-going and try to build a lead in the standings."
Cruz Pedregon won in Funny Car, Erica Enders in Pro Stock, and Jerry Savoie in Pro Stock Motorcycle.
Pedregon ran a 4.059 at 310.84 for his 36th career victory and first since Englishtown in 2014. He topped 16-time Funny Car champion John Force, Tommy Johnson Jr. and No. 1 qualifier Courtney Force in the final round for his second career win in Charlotte.
Enders raced to her 23rd career victory and second in Charlotte with a 6.535 at 212.73. She edged Vincent Nobile, Chris McGaha and Drew Skillman in the final round.
Jerry Savoie raced to his ninth career victory, running a 6.784 at 195.73 to top Andrew Hines, Scotty Pollacheck and Matt Smith.
