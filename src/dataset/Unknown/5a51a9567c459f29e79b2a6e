Lisa Michelle Stone and Joshua Ethan Grinker were married Jan. 6 at the River Cafe, a restaurant in Brooklyn. Dale Mandelman, a friend of the couple who became a minister with American Marriage Ministries for the event, officiated.
The bride, 48, is a principal and financial adviser at Bernstein Private Wealth Management, investment management firm in Manhattan. She serves on the Rockefeller University Committee on Trust and Estate Gift Plans in Manhattan. She is the co-president of the New York Chapter of Ellevate, a women’s networking organization. She graduated magna cum laude from Smith College in Northampton, Mass.
She is the daughter of Susan Stone and Paul Stone of Manhattan. The bride’s father retired as a jewelry designer and manufacturer for Ronald Stone Limited in Manhattan. Her mother retired as a research scientist in the Department of Ophthalmology at N.Y.U.
The groom, 50, is the chef and owner of Kings County Imperial and Stone Park Cafe, both in Brooklyn. He graduated from Macalester College in St. Paul and the New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vt.
He is a son of Miriam B. Grinker and William J. Grinker of Brooklyn. The groom’s mother retired as the director of communications for Planned Parenthood of New York City and Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn. His father retired as the chief executive and president of Seedco, a city-financed job agency and Seedco Financial Services, a nonprofit lender, both based in Manhattan. He served as the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration under Mayor Ed Koch, from 1986 to 1989.
The bride’s previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the groom’s.
