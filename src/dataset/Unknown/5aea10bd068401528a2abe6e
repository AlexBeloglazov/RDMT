WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme Court says Justice Sonia Sotomayor (SOHN'-ya soh-toh-my-YOR') has been released from the hospital following shoulder replacement surgery.
The court says Sotomayor is recuperating at home after the operation on her left shoulder Tuesday morning in New York.
The court said in a statement after the surgery that it had gone well and that the 63-year-old justice was expected to remain in the hospital for a night or two.
Sotomayor injured herself in a fall at home on April 16 and decided on the surgery after consulting with specialists.
The court says Sotomayor will wear a sling and curtail activities for the next few weeks while she recuperates. She is expected to need several months of physical therapy.
